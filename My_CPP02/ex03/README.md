## How to use test code
You have output_bsp_test_csv.cpp file and test.ipynb file.
Pass the Point-type vertices of triangle ABC and the output CSV fileâ€™s ofstream to output_bsp_test_csv().
Assign the path of the generated CSV file to the path variable in Jupyter Notebook.
Points determined to be inside the triangle will be plotted in blue, otherwise in red, on the scatter plot.
Feel free to modify the local variable N in output_bsp_test_csv() or edit the Jupyter Notebook as needed.
